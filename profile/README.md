## The Virtual Embodiment Lab in the Cornell Communication Department studies embodiment and presence in virtual environments.

We ask how the way you see your own and others’ actions represented affects how you understand your self, others and your environment.  We also explore how changing this representation can change people’s perceptions and allow them to collaborate, learn, and experience in ways that they can’t in the real world.
